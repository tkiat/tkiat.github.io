# Blog
[**My personal blog**](https://tkiat.github.io/freedom-oriented-blog/) is hosted on a small, unknown GitHub pages. The theme of the blog is directed towards freedom with the following sections: **Environment**, **FOSS**, **Media**, **Personal**, **Web**. I am planning to separate each topic into a dedicate site, which should be super fun but also very ambitious.

# Youtube
I did a small [**gaming channel**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC89LAwZdhzEAQWOjLFLcbWg) of around 5 videos but already stopped long ago. I just created a [**new channel**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgCypxL_GouQb_kpDrHOIyQ) focusing on open-source software. Currently, it only has one SuperTux video available but I plan to add some reviews or tutorials down the road.

* **Tea**. My first love with tea began when I was in Germany where a selection of high-quality tea was available there. Now in Thailand I can't taste tea any longer.
* **Shaving**. I have tried new blades from time to time but still haven't tried a real straight razor, a shaving brush, and fancy soaps.
* **Gardening**. I don't like the pesticide and also plastic packages so I am growing some plants (ผักบุ้ง, ผักกาดหอม, ตั้งโอ๋).
* **Reading Technical Blogs**. The freedom provided by web and Linux is an eye-opener for me.
* **Reading Books**. Currently not so active as I am reading only blogs now.

* **Cycling**. I used to regularly cycle between cities in Germany and the Netherlands. Unfortunately, the road in Thailand is not as bicycler-friendly. I am still riding it to buy food from markets.
* **Video Games**. I used to play a lot of collectible card games and RPGs but now I find coding more fun, more useful, and totally liberating.
* **Travelling**. I currently don't have both time and money for that. I am currently busy in front of my computer.
* **Collecting TCG Cards**. Inactive since high school.
